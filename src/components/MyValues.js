            <p> <b>Straightforwardness</b>
            <br/> 
            Simple and direct tends to be the most honest and transparent which helps build mutual trust
            </p>

            <p> <b>Open-mindedness</b>
            <br/> 
            Being able to see other perspectives and especially ones that conflict with your own opens you up to new ways of thinking 
            which leads to innovation but also tolerance of diversity.
            </p>
